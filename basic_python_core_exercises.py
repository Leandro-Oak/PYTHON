##FizzBuzz

#The given code solves the FizzBuzz problem and uses the word "Solo" and "Learn" instead of Fizz and Buzz.
#It take a input n and outputs the number from 1 to n

#For each multiple of 5, prints "Learn" instead of the number.
#For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, outputs "SoloLearn"
#You need to change the code to skip the even numbers, so thta logic only applies to odd numbers in the range.
